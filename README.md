A simple text pad with image slides in the background. Microcommission by [Dia](https://www.diaart.org).

## Instructions:
- Save the images in the same directory as index.html. Name them `1.jpg`, `2.jpg`, ... in the order in which you want to present.
- Hot keys for interfacing (for MacOS only): <br>
   `⌘(cmd)` + `delete`: clear text from the screen <br>
   `⌘(cmd)` + `→` : go to next image<br>
   `⌘(cmd)` + `←` : go to next image<br>
- Optionally you can adjust the text size using the UI at the bottom of the screen. (Only shows up as you hover over them)
